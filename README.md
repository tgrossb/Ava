## Ava ##
This is unpackaged source for the Ava Compiling and Executing tool, or ava for short.  This tool was created to simplify compiling and running Java programs from the command line.  It simplifies 
compiling multiple files organized into packages and is able to export compiled files into seperate directories.  Feel free to download and use or modify this tool for easy use.

## Installing ##
If you want to install this tool, I would recommend installing the python version.  See the python directory for installation instructions.

## Versions ##
Developement has been split into two streams, one is a bash script implementation, and the other is written in python.  The bash version is currently functional, but there are still functions I would like to 
implement.  The python version is fully functional, and developement is continuing to move quickly.  I am not currently developing the bash version, and once the python version is more function, developement on 
the bash front will stop completely.

Have an idea for a new feature? Let me know so I can do my best to add it to the tool.
