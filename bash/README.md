## Bash ##
This version uses the bsah scripting language, and is currently fully functional.  Developement on this front will be slow until the python version catches up, at which point developement on this version 
will halt.  There are still some features I would like to implement, but progress on these features will be slow.


## Features ##
- [X] Multiple and parallel file compiling
- [X] Automatic running
- [X] Project and individual logging options
- [X] Project home recognition
- [X] External library compiling available
- [X] Color and logging per user configurations
- [X] Automatic per user and default configuration file generation
- [ ] Clickable error output to take the user to the error

Have an idea for a new feature? Let me know so I can do my best to add it to the tool.
