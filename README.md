## Bash ##
This version uses the bsah scripting language, and is currently fully functional.  Developement on this front has been slow, and will probably stop soon. 
There are still some features I would like to implement, but progress on these features will be slow. I would not use this version, as it is all-around worse than the python version.


## Features ##
- [X] Multiple and parallel file compiling
- [X] Automatic running
- [X] Project and individual logging options
- [X] Project home recognition
- [X] External library compiling available
- [X] Color and logging per user configurations
- [X] Automatic per user and default configuration file generation
- [ ] Clickable error output to take the user to the error

Have an idea for a new feature? Let me know so I can do my best to add it to the tool.
